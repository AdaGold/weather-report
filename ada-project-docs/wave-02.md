## Wave 2: Increase and Decrease Temperature

### Requirements

A numeric temperature must be displayed. This temperature can be in either Fahrenheit or Celsius degrees.

There must be two clickable elements:

1. An element that increases the temperature by one degree on click
1. An element that decreases the temperature by one degree on click

#### Temperature Ranges Change Text Color

Depending on what temperature it is, either:

- the temperature number changes color
- the background of the temperature changes color

There must be at least five categories of distinguishable colors.

Our solution uses the following ranges, which you may use if desired:

| Temperature (F) | Color  |
| --------------- | ------ |
| 80+             | Red    |
| 70-79           | Orange |
| 60-69           | Yellow |
| 50-59           | Green  |
| 49 or below     | Teal   |

#### Temperature Ranges Change Landscape

Depending on what temperature it is, a different landscape should appear on the page.

These landscapes can be anything, as long as they are visual and noticeable to any instructors. For example, the landscapes can be:

- A single image that appears
- ASCII art
- Text

Changing landscapes should _replace_ the existing landscape. There should only be one visible landscape at a time.

There must be at least four landscapes.

Our solution uses the following ranges, which you may use if desired:

| Temperature (F) | Landscape                         |
| --------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 80+             | `"🌵__🐍_🦂_🌵🌵__🐍_🏜_🦂"`       |
| 70-79           | `"🌸🌿🌼__🌷🌻🌿_☘️🌱_🌻🌷"`      |
| 60-69           | `"🌾🌾_🍃_🪨__🛤_🌾🌾🌾_🍃"`        |
| 59 or below     | `"🌲🌲⛄️🌲⛄️🍂🌲🍁🌲🌲⛄️🍂🌲"` |
